### Translation:
You want to have this program translated to your language? You know 2 languages? Then fork this repository (Click on "Fork" in the upper right). Navigate to *- Path comes later -* and copy one of the lang-files. The new file needs to be named after your language-code. The code for your language can be found [here](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Language#Available_languages). Translate as much Text-Strings as you can *without* changing %1$s and similar. You can then create a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/ThexXTURBOXx/Math-Toolbox/compare) and we will include your language into the program. <br>

### API:
There will be an API soon *(hopefully ;))*
