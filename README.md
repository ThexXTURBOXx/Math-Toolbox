# Math Toolbox
This program gets written by ThexXTURBOXx. <br>
Once it's finished, it will compute everything you need for your school/study. <br>

### System Requirements:
 - Java 6/7/8 (it doesn't matter, if it is 32-bit or 64-bit)

### Important links:
[Downloads, when ready](https://github.com/ThexXTURBOXx/Math-Toolbox/releases) <br>

### Translation:
You want to have this program translated to your language? You know 2 languages? You want to help me out? <br>
1. Then fork this repository (Click on "Fork" in the upper right) <br>
2. Navigate to /Math Toolbox/src/main/resources/de/thexxturboxx/resources/lang/ and copy one of the lang-files. <br>
3. The new file needs to be named after your language-code. The code for your language can be found [here](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Language#Available_languages). <br>
4. Translate as much Text-Strings as you can *without* changing %1$s and similar. <br>
5. You can then create a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/ThexXTURBOXx/Math-Toolbox/compare) and I will include your language into the program. <br>
6. Thanks for participating and helping! I will try to give credit in some way to you!

### API:
There will be an API soon *(hopefully ;) )*
